* BPM-Emacs

This repository is the home for my personal emacs configuration.
It's currently very rudimentary and lacks a lot of essential modules that will be added later.
	
** Priorities
- [ ] Add something for workspaces (perspective.el maybe)
- [ ] Add LSP-Mode
- [ ] Add Rubcop autolinting
- [ ] Add Typescript syntax highlighting
- [ ] Add graphviz support
- [ ] Fix bugs ->

*** Bugs
- which-key has a modeline that blocks words
- vterm doesn't have the same colorscheme as the rest of the editor

** Inspiration
