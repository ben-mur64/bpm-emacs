* BPM-Emacs

This repository is the home for my personal emacs configuration.
It's currently very rudimentary and lacks a lot of essential modules that will be added later.

* Priorities

[x] - Add Counsel and Swiper
[x] - Add EVIL mode
[x] - Add general.el for improved keybindings
[ ] - Add org-mode
